There are 7 different types of conditional rules that can be applied to vehicles:
	
	-<color #FFFF00>Service</color> - Filter the vehicles by a specific service (like Residential - the private cars, Commercial, Health Care, etc). Most of the values are self-explainable, but there's no localization for them. Use <color #FFFF88>Any</color> option to apply the rule to all buildings in the city.
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Subservice</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter field to Subservice. Note that only some subservices applies to a Service. Select <color #FFFF88>Any</color> as Service if not sure about the Service that contains the subservice.
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Level</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter to Level. Level is used in vehicles just to filter in the game some kind of different source buildings for the same vehicle type (like Prision Van x Police Department regular patrol car).
	-<color #FFFF00>Service, Subservice & Level</color> - Mix all the rules below, becaming even more specific.
	-<color #FFFF00>Item Class</color> - Item classes in game are used to group assets into a behavior or category. They are named, so is easier to suppose what they do. 
	-<color #FFFF00>Asset Name</color> - Most restrictive rule, only will apply the rule to just one asset. Type the name to find it on the list.
	-<color #FFFF00>Owner Building</color> - It will link the vehicle color to the building it belongs to. It will apply to the any instance of the building in the city.
