The <color #FFFF00>{0}</color> have the tools to organize and set the right priority for each color rule.
<BR>The rules are listed in apply order. In this example the <color #FFFF00>Rule 1</color> will be apply first than any other rule. If the <color #FFFF00>Rule 1</color> doesn't match the current processing building, so the <color #FFFF00>Rule 2</color> will be applied, and so on.
The rules conditions can be setted on rule editor at right. Just click in the rule item in the list to open it for editing.
<BR>The low button bar have options for add/move/remove rules.

- Use the <sprite K45_New> button to create a new rule - it will be added to the end of the list as default
- Use the arrow buttons to change the rule priority (<sprite K45_Up> raises it priority, <sprite K45_Down> lower it)
- Use the <sprite K45_X> button to remove the current selected rule
<BR>Use the <sprite K45_Export> button to <color #FFFF00>export the entire ruleset</color> into the mod library. All ruleset exported here are contained into a file in the mod configurations folder. Locate it at:

<color #FFFF00>{1}</color>
<BR>Use the <sprite K45_Import> button to <color #FFFF00>import an entire ruleset</color> from the mod library. Any previous saved ruleset can be selected in a popup that will be opened. Of course, you can import it manually from another place by replacing the library file for another.
