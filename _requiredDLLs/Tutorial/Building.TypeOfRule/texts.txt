There are 6 different types of conditional rules that can be applied to buildings:
	
	-<color #FFFF00>Service</color> - Filter the buildings by a specific service (like Residential, Commercial, Health Care, etc). Most of the values are self-explainable, but there's no localization for them. Use <color #FFFF88>Any</color> option to apply the rule to all buildings in the city.
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Subservice</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter field to Subservice. Note that only some subservices applies to a Service. Select <color #FFFF88>Any</color> as Service if not sure about the Service that contains the subservice.
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Level</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter to Level. Level is used to some specific Services or Subservices to categorize the assets to an wealth level (like the growable levels) or importance (Prision x Police Department).
	-<color #FFFF00>Service, Subservice & Level</color> - Mix all the rules below, becaming even more specific.
	-<color #FFFF00>Item Class</color> - Item classes in game are used to group assets into a behavior or category. They are named, so is easier to suppose what they do. 
	-<color #FFFF00>Asset Name</color> - Most restrictive rule, only will apply the rule to just one asset. Type the name to find it on the list.
	
	These rules are combined with the <color #FFFF00>District restriction rules</color>, and only will be applied if both allow it.
<BR>Some tips:
	- Always ordenate your rules from most to less restrictive. It will ensure that all rules have a chance to be applied.
	- Choose well your rule names. It will help you when organizing the rule list.
	- Pillars are buildings too! So you can change their colors here. Try some Item Class groups related to it (like Highway) to make some customization
