The props rules applies to all <color #FFFF00>manually placed, buildings' and segments' props</color>, but you can filter the behavior by using the filters below.

There are 14 different types of conditional rules that can be applied to props:
	
	-<color #FFFF00>Service</color> - Filter the props by a specific service (like Residential, Industry, Commercial, etc). Most of the values are self-explainable, but there's no localization for them. Use <color #FFFF88>Any</color> option to apply the rule to all props in the city.
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Subservice</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter field to Subservice. Note that only some subservices applies to a Service. Select <color #FFFF88>Any</color> as Service if not sure about the Service that contains the subservice. 
	-<color #FFFF00>Service & Level</color> - Same than Service, but adds another filter to Level. Seems not to be effective in props...
	-<color #FFFF00>Service, Subservice & Level</color> - Mix all the rules below, becaming even more specific. Not so effective for props...
	-<color #FFFF00>Item Class</color> - Item classes in game are used to group assets into a behavior or category. They are named, so is easier to suppose what they do. 
	-<color #FFFF00>Asset Name</color> - Most restrictive rule, only will apply the rule to just one asset. Type the name to find it on the list.
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Building Name</color> - Applies the rule to all props in the selected building. All them!
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Building + Prop Name</color> - Applies the rule to defined prop in the selected building.
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Net Name</color> - Applies the rule to all props in the selected network (road, rails, electricity towers...). All them!
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Net + Prop Name</color> - Applies the rule to defined prop in the selected network (road, rails, electricity towers...).
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Service</color> - Same as service, but uses the parent asset (building/net) data to define if the rule will apply.
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Service & Subservice</color> - Same as Service & Subservice, but uses the parent asset (building/net) data to define if the rule will apply.
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Service, Subservice & Level</color> - Same as Service, Subservice & Level, but uses the parent asset (building/net) data to define if the rule will apply.
	-<color #FFFF00>Parent Item Class</color> - Same as Item Class, but uses the parent asset (building/net) data to define if the rule will apply.
	
<BR>Some tips:
	- Always ordenate your rules from most to less restrictive. It will ensure that all rules have a chance to be applied.
	- Choose well your rule names. It will help you when organizing the rule list.
	- Use the Parent Building/Net options to customize the props in a specific lot. It can increase the game randomness.
	- Use this mod along Network Skins 2 to create unique roads in the game! (also with more color variations on spawned assets)
